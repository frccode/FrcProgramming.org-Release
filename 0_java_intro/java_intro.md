# Part 0 - Introduction to Java in FRC Programming

!!! Warning
    If you choose to skip this step, make sure either you have an acceptable understanding of the Java programming language, or your team plans to use a different programming language before doing so.

While it is possible to use Python and C++ to program competition robots, which a few teams do so, most teams choose to use Java. Java is generally easier, more beginner-friendly, and there is much more online support in FRC programming for Java compared to other programming languages. Since you are here, your team is not one of the few which don't use Java. As a result, in order to begin programming, you must first have a solid background in the Java programming language.

## Learning Java

There are many ways to learn Java. Countless websites, online courses, and Youtube videos teach the topic. It's completely fine to find one which suits your liking, and it is definitely not necessary to use the ones listed below. However, here are a few resources which can get you started.

!!! Tip
    It's not necessary to learn all of Java, only the basics. FRC programming is really just the use of imported packages which allows the code to interact with the robot. Most (if not all) functions and classes you will need are built in with these packages.
